<h2> Background </h2>

<p> You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming
social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know 
what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is 
up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information 
and to define several procedures that operate on the network. </p> 

<h2> Description </h2>

<p> Each procedure is described in the comments in the .py file. </p>
